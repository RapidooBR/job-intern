# Rapidoo Internship Program 18/19

***Why Rapidoo?***

For many small businesses, invoice factoring (desconto de duplicatas) is the only place to go when they run into financial difficulties and lose bank credit. Despite being a R$200B / year market, factoring in Brazil is broken. Because processes are antiquated and inefficient, interest rates are much higher than they should be. At Rapidoo (https://rapidoo.com.br), our mission is to fix this problem and help Brazil’s micro-entrepreneurs grow their businesses and create jobs. Using technology to automate operations and optimize risk management, our self-service online platform offers a much better experience and fair interest rates.

We are a well-funded, early stage fintech startup looking for interns to help us scale our credit operation to hundreds of millions of R$ and tens of thousands of customers. You might be our girl or guy if you are self-motivated, self-disciplined, and get excited by the idea of building something big from zero that will make a real difference in people’s lives.

***What you'll do***

-	Being a pre-Series A startup, you will likely progress through several different areas, helping us take on emerging challenges as we scale.
-	Past interns have evolved from customer service to designing our collections processes, conducting credit analyses, and running our content marketing strategy.

***Profile***

-	Ask the right questions: What we are doing hasn’t been done before, so learning quickly is more important than prior experience. 
-	Analytical thinker: Startups are inherently chaotic places. You help reduce entropy through a structured approach to problem solving. 
-	Self-motivated to get things done: You can be manager and analyst at the same time to drive your projects to completion autonomously. 
-	Team worker: You’ll constantly work with others, from solving customer issues to defining product specs. Excellent communication is key. 

***What you'll get***

-	Be part of a highly qualified team (Harvard Business School, USP, Goldman Sachs, Enjoei and Creditas);
-	Competitive compensation and frontline experience building a world-class startup from the ground up;
-	Opportunity to work side-by-side with our founders and executives, participate in strategic decisions and lead your own improvement projects;
-	Internship program for up to 2 years, with potential for full-time offer;
-	Work and play hard at our office, located minutes from Estação Faria Lima.
